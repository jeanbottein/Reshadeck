# Reshadeck+

This is a fork of a fork based on the work of [mspeedo/Reshadeck](https://github.com/mspeedo/Reshadeck) and originally [safijari/Reshadeck](https://github.com/safijari/Reshadeck).

**Important:** You must uninstall any other versions of Reshadeck for this fork to work correctly.

## Key Differences from Original Reshadeck
- Per-game profiles
- Dynamic parameters per shader
- Tested packaged shaders
- Grouped by package
- On-the-fly adapter for shaders to maximize compatibility
- Crash detection and circuit breaker with a master switch in case of problematic shaders

It is hosted here: [https://github.com/jeanbottein/ReshadeckPlus](https://github.com/jeanbottein/ReshadeckPlus).

Reshade Shader Loader for Decky Plugin Loader for the handheld Steam Game Loader. It ships with a small curated set of shaders.
More shaders can be added at the `~/.local/share/gamescope/reshade/Shaders` folder such that the `.fx` files are in the 
root of the `Shaders` folder. Then you can pick and apply the shader using the plugin.

# Caveats
- Shaders can caused dropped frames in some rare cases and could also lead to severe performance degradation
- Shaders will not be applied at startup
- Screenshots will not contain the shader (but videos recorded via Decky Recorder will)
- When in game, the QAM menu will not have the shader applied
- When not in a game, the whole OS will have the shader applied
- Not all features of reshade are supported
- Some shaders can cause the Deck to crash

# A note on Deck OLED Fringing Patterns
The subpixel pattern of the Steam Deck OLED (Samsung screen at least), leads to some fringing that is visible to a small minority of people.
It is possible to [largely eliminate this fringing](https://gist.github.com/safijari/1b936cbbdebe341fbe340bcfecb04450) using a shader. That 
shader is included by default in this plugin.
